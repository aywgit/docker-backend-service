# Using Docker Compose to Deploy Fullstack

A teaching tool for using Docker-Compose to quickly deploy a full stack application. Simply clone down, open your Docker desktop, and run `docker compose up` to spin up images for :ok_woman: the frontend client, :mailbox_with_mail: the server, and :open_file_folder::open_file_folder: a MongoDB-powered database. Alternatively, uncomment out line 4 and comment out line 5 of docker-compose.yml in order to see the Dockerfile in action.

This is a companion project to https://github.com/aywgit/catwalk and will fully deploy a questions and answers module for a retail product website.
